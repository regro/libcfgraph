  "summary": "These functions were developed to support functional data analysis as described in\nRamsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W. (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They\nwere ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An introduction appears\nin Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis\nwith R and Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script files working\nmany examples including all but one of the 76 figures in this latter book.  Matlab\nversions of the code and sample analyses are no longer distributed through CRAN,\nas they were when the book was published.  For those, ftp from <http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/>\nThere you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses,\nas well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional\ninformation. The changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and\nremoval of functions create.polynomial.basis, polynompen, and  polynomial. These\nwere deleted because the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were\nerrors in the code.\n"
