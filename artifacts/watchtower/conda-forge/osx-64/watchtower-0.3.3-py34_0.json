  "description": "Watchtower is a log handler for Amazon Web Services CloudWatch Logs. CloudWatch\nLogs is a log management service built into AWS. It is conceptually similar to\nservices like Splunk and Loggly, but is more lightweight, cheaper, and tightly\nintegrated with the rest of AWS.  Watchtower, in turn, is a lightweight adapter\nbetween the Python logging system and CloudWatch Logs. It uses the boto3 AWS\nSDK, and lets you plug your application logging directly into CloudWatch without\nthe need to install a system-wide log collector. It aggregates logs into batches\nto avoid sending an API request per each log message, while guaranteeing a\ndelivery deadline (60 seconds by default).\n",
