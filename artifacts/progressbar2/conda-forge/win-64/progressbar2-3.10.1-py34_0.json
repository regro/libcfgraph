A widget is an object that may display\ndifferently depending on the state of the progress bar. There are many types\nof widgets:\n\n - `Timer`\n - `ETA`\n - `AdaptiveETA`\n - `FileTransferSpeed`\n - `AdaptiveTransferSpeed`\n - `AnimatedMarker`\n - `Counter`\n - `Percentage`\n - `FormatLabel`\n - `SimpleProgress`\n - `Bar`\n - `ReverseBar`\n - `BouncingBar`\n - `RotatingMarker`\n - `DynamicMessage`\n\nThe progressbar module is very easy to use, yet very powerful. It will also\nautomatically enable features like auto-resizing when the system supports it.\n",
