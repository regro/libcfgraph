  "description": "TTK can handle scalar data defined either on regular grids or\ntriangulations, in 2D, 3D, or more. It provides a substantial collection\nof generic, efficient and robust implementations of key algorithms in\ntopological data analysis. It includes:\n\u00b7 For scalar data: critical points, integral lines, persistence diagrams,\n  persistence curves, merge trees, contour trees, Reeb graphs, Morse-Smale\n  complexes, topological simplification, topology-aware compression,\n  harmonic design;\n\u00b7 For bivariate scalar data: fibers, fiber surfaces, continuous\n  scatterplots, Jacobi sets, Reeb spaces;\n\u00b7 For uncertain scalar data: mandatory critical points;\n\u00b7 For time-varying scalar data: critical point tracking, nested tracking\n  graphs;\n\u00b7 For high-dimensional / point cloud data: dimension reduction,\n  persistence-based clustering;\n\u00b7 and more!\n",
