  "description": "This is an implementation of XML Schema for Python (supports versions 2.7\nand Python 3.3+).\n\nThis library arises from the needs of a solid Python layer for processing\nXML Schema based files for MaX (Materials design at the Exascale) European\nproject. A significant problem is the encoding and the decoding of the XML\ndata files produced by different simulation software. Another important\nrequirement is the XML data validation, in order to put the produced data\nunder control. The lack of a suitable alternative for Python in the\nschema-based decoding of XML data has led to build this library. Obviously\nthis library can be useful for other cases related to XML Schema based\nprocessing, not only for the original scope.\n",
