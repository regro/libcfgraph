  "description": "WhiteboxTools is an advanced geospatial data analysis platform developed by Prof. John Lindsay at\nthe University of Guelph's Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research Group. WhiteboxTools can be\nused to perform common geographical information systems (GIS) analysis operations, such as\ncost-distance analysis, distance buffering, and raster reclassification. Remote sensing and image\nprocessing tasks include image enhancement (e.g. panchromatic sharpening, contrast adjustments),\nimage mosaicing, numerous filtering operations, simple classification (k-means), and common image\ntransformations. WhiteboxTools also contains advanced tooling for spatial hydrological analysis\n(e.g. flow-accumulation, watershed delineation, stream network analysis, sink removal), terrain\nanalysis (e.g. common terrain indices such as slope, curvatures, wetness index, hillshading;\nhypsometric analysis; multi-scale topographic position analysis), and LiDAR data processing. LiDAR\npoint clouds can be interrogated (LidarInfo, LidarHistogram), segmented, tiled and joined,\nanalyized for outliers, interpolated to rasters (DEMs, intensity images), and ground-points can be\nclassified or filtered. WhiteboxTools is not a cartographic or spatial data visualization package;\ninstead it is meant to serve as an analytical backend for other data visualization software,\nmainly GIS.\n",
