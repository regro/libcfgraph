  "description": "Polymer Reference Interaction Site Model (PRISM) theory describes the\nequilibrium spatial-correlations of liquid-like polymer systems including\nmelts, blends, solutions, block copolymers, ionomers, liquid crystal\nforming polymers and nanocomposites. Using PRISM theory, one can calculate\nthermodynamic (e.g., second virial coefficients, Flory-Huggins interaction\nparameters, potentials of mean force) and structural (eg., pair correlation\nfunctions, structure factors) information for these macromolecular\nmaterials.  pyPRISM is a Python-based, open-source framework for conducting\nPRISM theory calculations. This framework aims to simplify PRISM-based\nstudies by providing a user-friendly scripting interface for setting up and\nnumerically solving the PRISM equations. pyPRISM also provides data\nstructures, functions, and classes that streamline PRISM calculations,\nallowing pyPRISM to be extended for use in other tasks such as the\ncoarse-graining of atomistic simulation force-fields or the modeling of\nexperimental scattering data. The goal of this framework is to reduce the\nbarrier to correctly and appropriately using PRISM theory and to provide a\nplatform for rapid calculations of the structure and thermodynamics of\npolymeric fluids and nanocomposites.\n",
