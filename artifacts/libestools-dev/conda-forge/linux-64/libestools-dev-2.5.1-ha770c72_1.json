  "description": "The Edinburgh speech tools system is a library of C++ classes, functions\nand utility programs that are frequently used in speech software. The\nsystem compiles to a single unix library .a file which can be linked with\nsoftware. At present, C++ classes for several useful speech and language\nclasses have been written, along with audio software and some basic signal\nprocessing software.\n",
