Compatible with Python 2.7+ and 3.4+.\nAll design decisions is based on simplicity. Speed is not first priority.\nKuyruk only supports RabbitMQ and does not plan to support any other\nbackend. Kuyruk is designed for long running mission critical jobs. For\nthis reason Kuyruk sends acknowledgement only after the task is fully\nprocessed.\n",
