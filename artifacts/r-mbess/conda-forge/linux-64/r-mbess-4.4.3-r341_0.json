That being said, many of the methods  implemented within MBESS are applicable to a wide variety of disciplines. MBESS has a  suite of functions for a variety of related topics, such as effect sizes, confidence intervals  for effect sizes (including standardized effect sizes and noncentral effect sizes), sample size planning (from the accuracy in parameter estimation [AIPE], power analytic, equivalence, and  minimum-risk point estimation perspectives), mediation analysis, various properties of  distributions, and a variety of utility functions. MBESS (pronounced 'em-bes') was originally  an acronym for 'Methods for the Behavioral, Educational, and Social Sciences,' but at this  point MBESS contains methods applicable and used in a wide variety of fields and is an  orphan acronym, in the sense that what was an acronym is now literally its name.
